# Cleanup Summary

This document lists all the files that were removed during the cleanup process to eliminate test data, test files, and mock data from the project.

## Files Removed

### 1. Debug Scripts (backend/src/)
- `analyze-claude-code-issue.ts`
- `debug-output-files.ts`
- `debug-stuck-tasks.ts`
- `fix-download-routes.ts`
- `fix-execution-issues.ts`
- `fix-stuck-tasks.ts`
- `quick-fix-download.ts`
- `check-files.ts`
- `check-attachments-table.ts`
- `check-stuck-tasks.ts`
- `test-file-endpoints.ts`
- `test-upload.ts`

### 2. Temporary Service Files
- `backend/src/services/claude-code-executor-enhanced.service.ts`
- `backend/src/services/claude-code-executor-patch.ts`
- `backend/src/index-enhanced.ts`

### 3. Test Files
- `backend/src/browser-download-test.html`
- `frontend/src/__tests__/` (empty test directory)

### 4. Temporary Documentation
- `backend/CLAUDE_CODE_ISSUE_SOLUTION.md`
- `backend/TIMEZONE_ANALYSIS.md`
- `backend/test-download.md`
- `backend/outputs/test-download.txt`

### 5. Compiled Debug Files
All compiled JavaScript versions of the above TypeScript files were removed from `backend/dist/`.

## Files Kept

### Development/Testing Infrastructure
These files were kept as they are useful for development:
- `scripts/mock-claude-code.sh` - Mock Claude Code for testing
- `scripts/test-execution.js` - Test script for mock execution
- `frontend/vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration (for future tests)
- `.env.example` - Example environment configuration
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development Docker configuration
- `start-dev.sh` - Development startup script

### Directory Structure
Created `.gitkeep` files in empty directories to preserve structure:
- `outputs/.gitkeep`
- `uploads/.gitkeep`
- `claude-code-workspace/.gitkeep`
- `logs/.gitkeep`

## Code Changes

### Import Fixes
Updated imports that referenced removed files:
- `backend/src/index.ts`: Changed from `ClaudeCodeExecutorEnhanced` to `ClaudeCodeExecutor`
- `backend/src/services/task-execution-monitor.service.ts`: Updated to use standard executor

## .gitignore
The `.gitignore` file was already properly configured to exclude:
- `node_modules/`
- Database files (`*.db`)
- Build outputs (`dist/`, `build/`)
- Log files
- Environment files (`.env`)
- Output directories content

## Result
The project is now clean of unnecessary test files and debug scripts while maintaining all essential development tools and infrastructure.
